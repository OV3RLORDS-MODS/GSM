üéÆ Welcome to GSM - Game Server Manager!

Thanks for stopping by! I‚Äôm thrilled to share GSM with you‚Äîa tool born out of my own frustration with the high costs, complex setups, and lackluster features of existing game server panels. After years of hosting game servers, I decided to create something better.

As a solo developer, my focus with GSM is all about delivering top-notch functionality over flashy design. While the interface will evolve, my priority is to provide you with a powerful, effective tool that gets the job done. GSM isn‚Äôt your typical web panel‚Äîyou‚Äôll install it and run it directly from the terminal. Keep an eye on GitHub or join our Discord community for updates and announcements.

GSM offers seamless control and monitoring of your servers with a user-friendly interface and a rich set of features designed to make server administration a breeze. Whether you‚Äôre a beginner or a seasoned admin, GSM is here to enhance your server management experience. üåü
